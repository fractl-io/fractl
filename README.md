# Fractl

Fractl is a new and very different kind of programming language. It enables simultaneous coding in traditional IDEs, visual development in a no-code builder and code generation with generative-AI.

# The Future of Programming is tri-modal

We are marching towards a world where developers will build applications using a combination of 3 different approaches - traditional coding, no-code/visual development and AI-powered code generation. At least, they would like to.

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to reach this tri-modal nirvana with existing programming tools. On the one hand, widely-used programming languages are too low-level, dealing with bits and bytes of programming, and are burdened by esoteric, intricate syntax. This makes them a poor fit for both no-code development and AI-driven code generation. On the other hand, existing no-code platforms haven't been enthusiastically embraced by professional developers. This is due to the fact that they are closed tools with proprietary abstractions and go against the grain of modern development ethos of openness.

For the triad of programming approaches to root, to work together cohesively for the modern developer, a new programming language and abstraction is needed.

# Fractl is tri-modal

Fractl is the new programming language that unlocks the future of tri-modal development. Fractl has 3 facets:

1. fractl language: A data-oriented programming language, with a business-level abstraction, for professional developers
![Language]()
2. Fractl Design Studio: A No-code visual development environment
![Design Studio]()
4. Fractl Co-Pilot: A GenAI and LLM-powered tool, integrated into Design Studio, to generate fractl programs.

> Fractl is the industry's first **Generative AI-powered No-code Programming Language**

With fractl, developers can build applications 10x-100x faster than traditional development approaches.

# Fractl is innovative

**Fractl** introduces a number of innovative concepts to programming:

1. **[Graph-based Hierarchical Data Model](data-model.md)**
2. **[Zero-trust Programming](zero-trust-programming.md)**
3. **[Declarative Dataflow](declarative-dataflow.md)**
4. **[Resolvers](resolvers.md)**
5. **[Interceptors](interceptors.md)**
6. **[Entity-graph-Database Mapping](entity-db-mapping.md)**
